## (aka) About Me

<img src="{{"assets/images/matty-avatar.png" | relative_url}}" alt="Avator" class="left">
Hi, I'm Matt (my friends call me Matty).  Below is a little bit about me, what I value and my preferences around work.  My hope is that it will provide a little insight as we start to work together and promote conversation about how *we* can find a way to work well together.

## Values

- Agency - I value my own and treat yours with respect
- Logic and clear lines of reasoning - I value solutions that include a broader context of their environment/problem space, with a clear and logical line of reasoning to our short-term approach.
- Transparency - Visible, explicit, and accurate communication lets us all not guess as much.
- Collaboration - I enjoy working through problems in real time with others. I deeply believe that many perspectives produce better results. The shared ownership of problems and solutions has many ancillary benefits.
- Friendliness - I prefer to keep conversation light to promote a more analytical and reasoned approach to problem-solving. Sometimes, the stakes are high, and environments are stressful. Let's not add to that stress if we can help it.
  - no yelling
  - no blaming.

## How those values play out

- I prefer real-time communication.
- I love pairing. Not only when working on programming-related artifacts but anything prose, plans, etc
- I do my best to choose my words carefully. I say what I mean, mean what I say, and try my hardest not to insinuate anything.
- Please be friendly but blunt. How we collaborate is itself a collaboration, and we won't get it right the first time or without work.
- I work as transparently as possible. I share work very, very early before it's normally ready to be accepted. Please let me know if this is overwhelming or distracting.
- I examine problems - This can lead to slightly longer feedback cycles. This includes not only the problem space, but the many types of trade off that are present between possible solutions.
- I ask a lot of questions. Your answers and perspectives are super important in helping us choose an approach and direction that works for both of us.
- I believe in context, so I can sometimes be a little verbose.

## Technical Details

Are you a programmer that is intrested in how I think about the details related to making stuff? You are in luck. You have found the right section!

I see the details around the bits mainly through the lenses of...
* The 4 simple rules of design.
* Many More Much Smaller Steps
* Starting with the simplest thing that works.

I see the process of making stuff through the lenses of
* Delivering smaller amounts of value sooner and more regularly
* Sustainable pace.
* Ensuring the system is one that regularly learns from itself **and remembers** .
* Small 'p' plans.  Something quick, small, and easily adapts the inevitable changes through out a project. But a plan non-the-less.


Thanks for reading!!!
