# Hello!


![Avator]({{"assets/images/matty-avatar.png" | relative_url}}){: .left}Hey there! I'm Matty, a software developer returning to writing. After a hiatus from my previous blog, I'm excited to create a new space to share my thoughts.

While my content will primarily focus on technology, I'd like to talk about other aspects of building and creatingâ€”both in the digital and physical worlds. And who knows? You might even find some work-life balance insights sprinkled in.

As a programmer specializing in dynamic web languages, I'm planning to share content about:

* Adventures in Ruby and Python development - sharing useful patterns, common pitfalls, and interesting problems I've solved along the way
* Programming workflows and tools I use daily, including custom automations that make development life easier
* Infrastructure and operations insights, including my work with Puppet, Ansible, and Terraform
* Smart home solutions and home automation projects that make daily life easier
* Practical applications of AI in personal workflows, with a focus on real-world adoption and integration
* Physical building projects, from apartment renovations to boat and van conversions (because sometimes we need to step away from the keyboard!)

I'd love to hear your thoughts and engage in discussions about any of these topics! Social media links and email contact information will be coming soon. In the meantime, feel free to join our Slack community for some great conversations.

I hope to see you next week for my fist post(edits are being finished up as you read this) :)

Thanks for reading,
-Matty
